Foundations of Programming: Object-Oriented Design
'''
Intro.6
"To write any piece of software, we need to do three things:
    1. Understand our problem - Analysis
    2. Plan our solution - Design
    3. Build it - Programming
    "


1.2
    Objects in programming are similar to objects in real-life. They have:
        1. Identity (are separate from things like them)
        2. Attributes (characteristics about them, like names or colors)
        3. Behavior (they do something or receive some action)

1.3
    Classes have names, attributes, and methods (functions).

1.4 through 1.7
    APIE =
        Abstraction: Focus on the essential qualities of an example, leaving out extras
        Polymorphism: an object's ability to behave differently in different
            instances / situations.
        Inheritance: A subclass inherits all the attributes and behaviors of the
            superclass.
        Encapsulation = bundling attributes of a class together and hiding them
            from other parts of the application. This is less for secrecy and
            more for avoiding cascading problems when changing things.
