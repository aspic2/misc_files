Foundations of Programming: Object-Oriented Design
'''
Intro.6
"To write any piece of software, we need to do three things:
    1. Understand our problem - Analysis
    2. Plan our solution - Design
    3. Build it - Programming
    "


1.2
    Objects in programming are similar to objects in real-life. They have:
        1. Identity (are separate from things like them)
        2. Attributes (characteristics about them, like names or colors)
        3. Behavior (they do something or receive some action)

1.3
    Classes have names, attributes, and methods (functions).

1.4 through 1.7
    APIE =
        Abstraction: Focus on the essential qualities of an example, leaving out extras
        Polymorphism: an object's ability to behave differently in different instances / situations.
        Inheritance: A subclass inherits all the attributes and behaviors of the
            superclass.
        Encapsulation = bundling attributes of a class together and hiding them
            from other parts of the application. This is less for secrecy and
            more for avoiding cascading problems when changing things.

2.1
    Steps in the OO Analysis and Design Process:
        1. Gather requirements
            a) What does the app need to do?
        2. Describe the app
            a) Simple narrative of how people use the app to complete its goal.
        3. Identify the main objects
            a) Go back through the narrative, find the most important objects,
                actions, and results, and discard superfluous things
        4. Describe the Interactions
            a) Figure out how your objects interact with each other
        5. Create a Class Diagram

2.2
    Requirements - What must the program do?
    NOTE: Cut the fluff here. No half-formed ideas on what might be cool.
          Only things that it MUST have/do.
        Functional Requirements
            Features and Capabilities
        Non-Functional Requirements
            Help
            Legal
            Performance
            Support
            Security

        FURPS / FURPS+
            Functional requirements
            Usability requirements
            Reliability requirements
            Performance requirements
            Supportability requirements

            +
            Design requirements
            Implementation requirements
            Interface requirements
            Physical requirements

3.2
    UML - Unified Modeling Language
    Covered more below

3.1
    Use Cases - used to explain how and why a user will use the application
        Should be simple and in plain English
    Use cases have three parts:
        1) Title - short phrase, active verb
        2) Actor - person accomplishing goal
        3) Scenario - step-by-step on how the actor accomplishes goal
            Paragraph of short, declarative sentences
            Numbered list of steps
        3.5) Extensions - covers situations not seen in normal scenario
                Issues, Exceptions, etc.

3.2
    Actors are people (or systems) that live outside the application that
    need to accomplish goals within the application.
    -Determine if you need different roles or security clearance between different Actors
    -The same person could be different actors on different days, as the
        actor designation revolves around what they want to accomplish

3.3
    Identifying the scenarios
        Create user-focused goals (not "login to account", but rather
        what the user wants to do when they login.)
            -emphasize the goal of one encounter
        Sunny Day Use Case - describes what happens when everything goes correctly
        Include other common scenarios and how they are handled
        omit needless words. keep it simple

3.4
    Use case diagrams contain several different use cases and different Actors
    In UML, here are a few of the shapes / figures used:
        Complete Use Cases - Circled/Ellipsed text
        Actors - Stick figures with labels
        Knowledge Base (everythin within app) - Box (around all Use Cases)
        Connection between Actors and Use Cases - lines

3.5
    User stories - an alternative to use cases
        Shorter (1 to 2 sentences)
        written on index cards
        User stories follow a format:
            As a.. (type of user, e.g. Bank Customer)
            I want.. (goal, e.g. to change my PIN online)
            [so that.. (optional reason, e.g. I do not need to go to a branch)]
        User stories can be thought of as reminders for a conversation about
        how a program should work.

4.1
    Creating conceptual models
        Go a level deeper than user cases and user stories.
        Identify the objects necessary for your program
        Draw a diagram to represent how objects interact with each other
        Does not need to be complete; you will inevitably need to revisit
          and refine the models

4.2
    Identifying classes
        Go through use cases and user scenarios and pick out the nouns
            -These are your potential objects
        If you have duplicates or synonyms, remove the extras
        Nouns that are actually attributes (rather than class candidates) can be removed, too.

4.3
    Identifying class relationships
        It can be heplful to diagram the different classes and connect them with arrows
            State the relationship (contains a, creates, etc.) on the arrows

4.4
    Identify class responsibilities
        Go back through use cases and identify verbs and verb phrases
        Identify which object is responsible for which action
            An object should be responsible for itself.
                e.g. a Customer may ask to check order status, but this is an Order responsibility.
        Under Object name and attributes, write object's responsibilities.

4.5
    Using CRC Cards
        CRC - Class, Responsibility, Collaboration
        made on index cards. one class per card
        Class Name - up top
        Responsibilities - left 2/3rds of card
        Collaborators - right 1/3 (the other objects it interacts with)

5.1
    Creating class diagrams
        Use UML format to name each Class, its attributes, and its operations
            Class name - Uppercase first letter
            Attributes - Pascal case (ex. isActive, lineNumber, etc.)
                with data type - "name: String = 'New Product'"
            Operations - Pascal case
                with parameters and return - "displayProduct(): return String"
            **get and set (e.g. getTitle) are used for operations that alter or retrieve attributes
        Focus more on what classes do (responsibilities), rather than attributes

5.2
    Converting class diagrams to code
        The techniques here should convert to any programming language.

5.3
    Exploring object lifetime
    Python's __init__ is a 'constructor method'. It allows you to create objects with attributes already assigned, rather than empty objects
        you can overload constructors, i.e. give two init functions.
            this allows you to initialize them differently (e.g. with or without parameters).

  5.4
      Using static and shared members
          For variables that have a single value across instances of a class
          To get a static variable, reference it with the class name rather than instance name
          Static variables are accessible even if there are no instances created of that class.
          static attributes and behaviors are represented with an underline ___ in UML.


6.1
    Inheritance
        -describes an "is a" relationship
            (Ex. A car is-a vehicle. A bus is-a vehicle. A Pomeranian is-a dog is-a mamman is-an animal)
        -The goal is to recognize shared attributes and behaviors in objects, that way we code them once (in the Parent class) and all other objects have them.
        -Sub-classes (or Child classes) inherit all attributes and methods from the super class unless they are Overridden
        -Recognize false inheritance opportunities and avoid coding them:
            (Ex. A Bank is not a Bank Account, nor is a Bank Account a Bank. There is no inheritance here.)
        Avoid excessive levels of inheritance, it should be natural

6.2
    Using inheritance
        benefit of inheritance: allows child class to use methods defined in parent class.
            usually done with the 'super' keyword.
                ex. super.doSomething():

6.3
    Using abstract classes (classes that are not instantiated)
        Certain languages use keywords to ensure that a class 'cannot' be instantiated. These are abstract classes.
        Other classes are assumed to be capable of instantiation. They can be called 'concrete' classes.

6.4
    Using interfaces
        -list of method signatures
        -an instantiated class can 'implement' these (define behaviors for them). From then on, other classes can use these methods without knowing anything else about them.
        -interfaces are not natively supported in Python
