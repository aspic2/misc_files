Notes from Python class

Very simple syntax

"print [variable]" is all you need to print

[variable name] = to set variables

Data types include integers, booleans (True, False)

Whitespace is important. You must indent certain things for them to work.

One line comments use #. You can write several line comments within triple
quotes """  """

Math Operations are same as most languages

	addition = +
	subtraction = -
	multiplication = *
	division = /
	Exponents = **
	modulo (remainder) = %


Three ways to create strings
	'string'
	"string"
	str(string)

String methods
	len("string") = length of characters in string
	"String".upper() = converts string to upper case
	"String".lower() = converts string to lower case



Comparators:
	< less than
	> greater than
	<= less than or equal to
	>= greater than or equal to
	== equal to
	!= not equal to


Boolean operators (REVIEW THIS SECTION)
	True == the statement is true
	False == the statement is false

Conditional statements
	if
	else
	elif == else if


**Protip** - if you want to print and return, put print before return. Return
ends the command.

Understand brackets vs. parentheses in Python

command line stuff:
    cd "Folder\Folder"
		    Change directory. this is how you get around

		cd..
				back out one folder

		C:, or D:, etc.
		    Change your drive

		dir
				show all folders and files in the current directory

		python
				initiate python in your shell. this also prefaces calls to run script

		python -m pydoc <name>
				look something up in pydoc from the command line

		quit()
				exit python or whatever program you are in

		mkdir
				creates a folder in the current directory

-------------------------------------------------

python commands and input:

		print()
				outputs info to the screen

		#
				comments out the following line of text

		%
				modulo. finds the remainder of a number. if % == 0, number is even
				can also function as a string formatter, usually followed by a letter

		%s
				string formatter. Used as a placeholder within a string.

		%d
				number formatter. Used a placeholder within a string.

		%r
		 		raw formatter. Returns value exactly as written in python. Used as a
				placeholder in a string.

		round(number [, ndigits])
				rounds a floating point number to the decimals indicated. default is 0.

		\
				escape character. used to print exceptional characters in Python
				ex. print("He said \"Hello\"") will print the quotes around Hello

		\n
				print new line. Python recognizes this within strings

		input("optional text")
				prompts user for some sort of input. prints the string inside, if one.
